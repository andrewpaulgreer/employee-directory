# Employee-Tracker

## Description
This is the secondary repository to my original project called "user-directory". this is due to the improper formatting of folders, and inability to deploy, so this project had to be moved to this repository. This project is a directory table that can be sorted based off employee first name, and a user can search an employees name as well.
